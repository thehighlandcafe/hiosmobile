                <br><br>
                This Privacy Policy outlines the collection, use, and protection of personal information when you use HiOSMobile for Android, and HiOSMobile for Web, open-source applications created by HiOSMobile and The Highland Cafe™️ Enterprises ("we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing, or using these applications, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                1.1 <b>Personal Information:</b> We do not collect information about you.
                The only personal information that is collected is collected by The Highland Cafe™️, and is information you give us, via our in-app forms.
                GitHub, who we use to host HiOSWebCore, does not collect any information at all.
                <br><br>
                1.2 <b>Non-Personal Information:</b> We don't collect any non-personal information.
                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                2.1 <b>Personal Information:</b> We may use your personal information for the following purposes:
                <ul>
                    <li>To communicate with you, respond to inquiries, and provide customer support.</li>
                    <li>To send you important updates, notifications, and information related to the apps.</li>
                    <li>To improve our services and apps.</li>
                </ul>
                2.2 <b>Non-Personal Information:</b> Again, we don't collect any non-personal information.
                <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
                We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.
                However, we may share your information in the following circumstances:
                <ul>
                    <li>With your explicit consent.</li>
                    <li>If required by law or in response to a valid legal request.</li>
                    <li>To protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property or that of our users or the public.</li>
                    <li>In connection with the sale, merger, or acquisition of all or part of our company, as permitted by law.</li>

                <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
                We are committed to protecting your information and employ reasonable security measures to safeguard your data.
                However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

                You have the following rights regarding your personal information:
                <ul>
                    <li>To speak to us via customer support to do a search on your data, then go on from there on your request.</li>
                    <li>To request the deletion of your personal information, via above method.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
                We may update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
                Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.
